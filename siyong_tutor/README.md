## intro

- `Siyong tutor`, a LLM for K12 students, built by __Siyong Education Tech. ltd.__. `Tutor` can explain problems and give lectures, check students' mastery of subject knowledge, provide study and review suggestions, and connect to the Siyong Education backend API to create personalized test papers for students.
 - `Siyong tutor` is based on `InternLM2.5` and is optimized using `Xtuner`. It utilizes `Langchain` for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and `LMdeploy` for deployment. Additionally, it supports `Gradio` as the front-end GUI. This model will open-source the Large Language Model (LLM) and configuration code. In the future, it will be launched on `OpenXLab`, `ModelScope`, and `Baidu AI Studio`.
 - This product (project) participates in the third phase of the InternLM Camp competition.
